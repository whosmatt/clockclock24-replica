Simple mechanical design for a clockclock24 wall clock compatible with the PCB design by [Vallasc](https://github.com/Vallasc), available here: [clockclock24-replica](https://github.com/Vallasc/clockclock24-replica)  

[3D Preview](clockclock24%20body%20(preview).stl)

## Body
The body is CNC-Milled from a 900x400mm board of 19mm MDF. A frame for wall-mounting and LED ambient lighting is constructed from the same 19mm MDF, cut into different-length strips. The frame is assembled and attached using regular wood glue. 

## PCB attachment
The assembled PCBs are attached using 4 identical 3D-printed spacers each, designed for an ST (self-tapping) 2.9 x 16 metric screw. When using the specified screw, the spacers will self-align the PCBs to the wooden body. 

## Clock arms
The clock arms are 3D-printed and designed to press-fit onto the motor shaft. Slight adjustments to the bore size may be needed to adjust for 3D-printer tolerances.
